# What is statistical learning?

* Refers to _a vast set of tools to understanding data_ (text book, p. 1).

* Focuses on the whole chain: 

model $\rightarrow$ method $\rightarrow$ algorithm $\rightarrow$ analysis $\rightarrow$ interpretation

* Both **prediction** and **understanding** (inference $\rightarrow$ drawing conclusions). 

* Statistical learning is a statistical discipline.


---

# Statistical Learning vs. ``Machine Learning'' 

Machine learning is more focused on the algorithmic part of learning, and is a discipline in computer science. 

But, many methods/algorithms are common to the fields of statistical learning and machine learning.


---

# Statistical Learning vs. ``Data Science''

In data science the aim is to 

* extract knowledge and understanding from data, and 
* requires a combination of statistics, mathematics, numerics, computer science and informatics. 

This encompasses the whole process of data acquisition/scraping, going from unstructured to structured data, setting up a data model, performing data analysis, implementing tools and interpreting results. 

In statistical learning we will not work on the two first above (scraping and unstructured to structured).


[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is an excellent read and relevant for this course!

---

# Problems you will learn to solve


There are **three main types of problems** discussed in this course:

* Regression

* Classification

* Unsupervised methods

using data from science, technology, industry, economy/finance, ...

---

# Example 1: Regression (Etiology of CVD)

* The Framingham Heart Study investigates the underlying causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (see <https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/>). 
<!--(In Norway we have the Health survey of Nord-Trondelag, HUNT - but not with data available for teaching.)-->

* Aim: modelling systolic blood pressure (\texttt{SYSBP}) using data from $n=2600$ persons. 

* For each person in the data set we have measurements of the following seven variables.

\scriptsize

* `SYSBP` systolic blood pressure (mmHg),
* `SEX` 1=male, 2=female,
* `AGE` age (years), 
* `CURSMOKE` current cigarette smoking at examination: 0=not current smoker, 1= current smoker,
* `BMI` body mass index,
* `TOTCHOL` serum total cholesterol (mg/dl),
* `BPMEDS` use of anti-hypertensive medication at examination: 0=not currently using, 1=currently using.
\normalsize

```

What does this plot show?

Red: male; turquoise: female

---

* Diagonal: density plot (generalization of histogram), or barplot.
* Lower diagonals: scatterplot, histograms
* Upper diagonals: correlations values or boxplots

---

### Etiology of CVD - model 

* A _multiple normal linear regression model_ was fitted to the data set with 
$$-\frac{1}{\sqrt{\texttt{SYSBP}}}$$ 
as response (output) and all the other variables as covariates (inputs). 

* The results are used to formulate hypotheses about the etiology of CVD - to be studied in new trials.

# Example 2: Classification (iris plants)

The `iris` flower data set is a very famous multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. 

The data set contains **three plant species** \{setosa, virginica, versicolor\} and **four features measured** for each corresponding sample: `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length` and `Petal.Width`.   

---


```{r iris_pic, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Iris plant with sepal and petal leaves", out.width = '150pt'}
knitr::include_graphics("iris.png")
```

\tiny
<http://blog.kaggle.com/2015/04/22/scikit-learn-video-3-machine-learning-first-steps-with-the-iris-dataset/>

---

\scriptsize
```{r iris, include=TRUE}
head(iris)
```
\normalsize

---

Aim: correctly classify the species of an iris plant from sepal length and sepal width.

```{r iriscont, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
ggpairs(iris, aes(colour=Species), title="Classification of Iris plants")
# irisplot = ggplot(data=iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) 
# irisplot = irisplot + geom_point(aes(color=Species)) 
# irisplot = irisplot + xlab("Sepal Length") + ylab("Sepal Width")
# irisplot = irisplot + ggtitle("Classification of Iris plants")
# irisplot
```

---

## Linear boundaries

In this plot the small black dots represent correctly classified iris plants, while the red dots represent misclassifications. The big black dots represent the class means.

&nbsp;  
  

```{r irislda, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5,out.width="10cm"}
library(klaR)
drawparti(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,  prec=301, gs=20,  method="lda", image.colors=c("#F8766D", "#00BA38", "#619CFF"), xlab="Sepal Length", ylab="Sepal Width", print.err=0)
legend("topright", title="Species", legend=c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"), fill=c("#F8766D", "#00BA38", "#619CFF"),  inset=.02 , cex=0.8)
```


---

## Non-linear boundaries

Sometimes a more suitable boundary is not linear.  
&nbsp;  
  
```{r irisqda,  echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5,out.width="10cm"}
drawparti(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, prec=301, gs=20,  method="qda", image.colors=c("#F8766D", "#00BA38", "#619CFF"), print.err=0, xlab="Sepal Length", ylab="Sepal Width")
legend("topright", legend=c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"),title="Species", fill=c("#F8766D", "#00BA38", "#619CFF"),  inset=.02 , cex=0.8)

```

# Example 3: Unsupervised methods (Gene expression)

* In a collaboration with researchers the Faculty of Medicine and Health the relationship between inborn maximal oxygen uptake and skeletal muscle gene expression was studied. 
* Rats were artificially selected for high- and low running capacity (HCR and LCR, respectively), 
* Rats were either kept seditary or trained. 
* Transcripts significantly related to running capacity and training were identified
<!--  (moderated t-tests from two-way anova models, false discovery rate controlled).  -->
* To further present the findings heat map of the most significant transcripts were presented (high expression are shown in red and transcripts with a low expression are shown in yellow).
* This is hierarchical cluster analysis with pearson correlation distance measure.

# Who is this course for?

## Primary requirements
* Bachelor level: 3rd year student from Science or Technology programs, and master/PhD level students with interest in performing statistical analyses.
* Statistics background: TMA4240/45 Statistics, ST1101+ST1201, or equivalent.

* No background in statistical software needed: but we will use the R statistical software extensively in the course. Knowing python will make this easier for you!

* Not a prerequisist but a good thing with knowledge of computing - preferably an introductory course in informatics, like TDT4105 or TDT4110.

---

## Overlap
* TDT4173 Machine learning and case based reasoning: courses differ in philosophy (computer science vs. statistics). See Bb under FAQ for more details.

* TMA4267 Linear Statistical Models: useful to know about multivariate random vectors, covariance matrices and the multivariate normal distribution. Overlap only for Multiple linear regression (M3).

---


# About the course

## Focus: Statistical theory **and** doing analyses

* The course has focus on **statistical theory**, but we apply all models and theory using (mostly) available function in R and real data sets. 

* It it important that the student in the end of the course **can analyse all types of data** (covered in the course) - not just understand the theory. 

* And vice versa - the student must also **understand** the model, methods and algorithms used. 



---

## Learning outcome

1. **Knowledge.** The student has knowledge about the most popular statistical learning models and methods that are used for _prediction_ and _inference_ in science and technology. Emphasis is on regression- and classification-type statistical models.

2. **Skills.** The student can, based on an existing data set, choose a suitable statistical model, apply sound statistical methods, and perform the analyses using statistical software. The student can present, interpret and communicate the results from the statistical analyses, and knows which conclusions can be drawn from the analyses, and what are the caveats.

# Teaching philosophy

## The modules
&nbsp;  

* Divide the topics of the course into modular units with specific focus.

* This (hopefully) facilitates learning?
 
* 12 modules (weeks of teaching) = 
    + introduction (this module) 
    + the 10 topics listed previously 
    + summing up  
&nbsp;   

* Two weeks without lectures (but supervision of exercises)

---

## The lectures 
&nbsp;  

**Mondays at 8.15-10 in S4 and Thursdays at 14.15-16.00 in F6 or Smia**
&nbsp;  

* We have $2\cdot 2$ hours of lectures every week (except when working with the compulsory exercises).
* Each week is a new topic and a new module
* Some weeks (modules 2,5,7 and 9) the second lecture is an _interactive lecture_ in Smia, where active learning is in focus (more below).
* The other weeks (modules 3,4,6,8,10 and 11) the second lecture is a plenary lecture in F6.
* The first week of the course the second lecture is replaced by an R workshop!

---

## The weekly supervision sessions 
&nbsp;  

**Thursdays 16.15-18 in Smia**
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

For each module *recommended exercises* are given. These are partly 

* theoretical exercises (from book or not)
* computational tasks
* data analysis

These are supervised in the weekly exercise slots. 

We have joint supervision sessions with the TMA4267 Linear statistical models course. 

TAs from both courses will be present.

---

## The compulsory exercises

* There will be **two compulsory exercises**, each gives a maximal score of 15 points.
* These are supervised in the weekly exercise slots and there will be one week without lectures (only with supervision) for each compulsory exercise.
* Focus is both on theory and analysis and interpretation in R.
* Students can work in groups (max size 3) and work must be handed in on Blackboard and be written in R Markdown (both .Rmd and .pdf handed in).
* The TAs grade the exercises.
* This gives 30% of the final evaluation in the course, and the written exam the final 70%.

# Student active learning

We (probably) all have different ways in which we learn - and we have different learning ambitions when attending a course.

&nbsp;   

## Felder and Silverman learning styles

Back in 1988 Felder and Silverman published an article where they suggested that there was a mismatch between the way students learn and the way university courses were taught. They devised a taxonomy for learning styles - where four different axis are defined:

---

1) active - reflective: How do you process information: actively (through physical activities and discussions), or reflexively (through introspection)?
2) sensing-intuitive: What kind of information do you tend to receive: sensitive (external agents like places, sounds, physical sensation) or intuitive (internal agents like possibilities, ideas, through hunches)?
3) visual-verbal: Through which sensorial channels do you tend to receive information more effectively: visual (images, diagrams, graphics), or verbal (spoken words, sound)?
4) sequential - global: How do you make progress: sequentially (with continuous steps), or globally (through leaps and an integral approach)?

<!-- Here are a few words on the four axis: <http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public//ILSdir/styles.pdf> -->

---

## The idea: 

* Acknowledging these different learning style axes 

* Choose teaching styles that matche the learning styles of the students. 

* Many students (according to Felder and coauthors) have a visual way of learning, and then teachers should spend time devising visual aids (in addition to verbal aids - that were the prominent aids in 1988), and so on. 


<!-- **Curious?** Standardized set of questions  that you may answer to learn more about your learning style. -->

<!-- Here is the questionnarie (maybe do a screen shot of your results -the results only appear on a web page and is not saved or emailed to you or anyone): <https://www.webtools.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/> -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- After you have noted your scores please go back and read the description of the four axis, but this time focus on the advice for the different type of learners. <http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSdir/styles.pdf> -->

<!-- If you are curios about the work of Felder and coauthors, more resources can be found here: <http://educationdesignsinc.com/> -->

---

## Student active learning in TMA4268

* Students have different background knowledge, learning ambitions and learning styles (verbal/visual, active/reflective, global/sequential, ...).
&nbsp;   

* Teachers aim to make diverse learning resources available in courses, and
&nbsp;      

* _promote student active teaching methods_.

&nbsp;    

**Hypothesis:** Students will learn better/deeper with a combination of different teaching methods.

---

Therefore we aim to:

* Provide learning environments, opportunities, interactions, tasks and instruction that foster deep learning.
* Provide guidance and support that challenges students based on their current ability. 
* Students discover their current strengths and weaknesses and what they need to do to improve. 

We will now focus on _active_ and _reflective_ learning styles and learning methods.

---

## Active vs. reflective learning styles


### What are student reflective learning methods/tasks?

* Plenary lectures
* Reading textbook
* Self study

---

### Plenary lecture

1) The teacher is lecturer
2) Limited amount of interaction student-lecturer
3) Limited amount of interaction student-student
4) Lecturer active, student passive
5) Where: lecture theatre, auditorium
6) Resources: (black)board, screen (for projector), microphone for lecturer, desks in rows.

&nbsp;   

**Positive**: By using the
traditional lecture method, lecturers can present a large amount of material
in a relatively brief amount of time.

**Negative**: is it also efficient for the student? Maybe efficient for students with a _reflective learning style_?

---

### What are student active learing methods/tasks?

* Pause in plenary lecture to ask questions and let students think and/or discuss.
* In-class quizzes (with the NTNU invention Kahoot!) - individual and team mode.
* Projects - individual or in groups.
* Group discussion
* Interactive lectures

---

### Interactive lecture

1) The teacher is not a lecturer, but an advisor, and teaching assistent (TA) may also be present
2) Focus on interaction student-teacher
3) Focus on interaction student-student
4) Student and teacher/TA both active
5) Where: a room designed for interaction, collaboration and activity
6) Resources: (white)boards, screens, group tables, laptop/PC, possibly a podium for short announcements

Positive: Studens are active. This is how work is done in many cooperative environments (your future workplace?).

Negative: Challenging group processes. Unfamiliar setting for students?

Challenge: requires dedicated space and suitable problems to work on in groups

---

### Innovative learning space: Smia

A room where interaction and activity is in focus. Flat floor with group tables, whiteboard and screen - PC and electricity outlets. 

 
&nbsp; 


<https://www.ntnu.no/laeringsarealer/smia>

---

## Interactive lectures in Smia 

(modules 2,5,7 and 9): Work alone,in pairs, or larger groups (lecturer help to form), introduction (5 min) - work on problem sets (35+, lecturer and TA supervise) - summing up (5 min), pause, repeat. Lecturer interrupts if common confusions or interesting observations by some of the tables.
